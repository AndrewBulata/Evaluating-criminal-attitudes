This study investigates decision-making in the context of online fraud, considering the influence of geopolitical provenance and retailer size on consumer action. Through a mixed-methods approach, survey participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario involving the unintended receipt of an additional laptop from an online retailer. The study employed direct ques- tioning and the item-count technique to evaluate participants’ choices. Findings from the direct cohort revealed a significant association between geopolitical provenance and ethical decisions: non-Western participants were substantially more likely to return the laptop than their Western counterparts. These findings align with expectations that individuals from stricter societies, often characterised by harsher regulations and greater law enforcement, may exhibit higher levels of compliance. However, no such differences emerged in the indirect cohort. Retailer size did not significantly influence decisions in either cohort, suggesting that perceptions of corporate influence or scale were not central to respondents’ behaviour. Crucially, the study highlights cultural norms as key drivers of moral decision-making while acknowledging the limitations of a small, student-focused sample and the challenges associated with Western versus non-Western classifications.
