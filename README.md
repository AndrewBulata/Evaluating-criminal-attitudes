This study investigates decision-making in the context of online fraud, considering the influence of geopolitical provenance and retailer size on consumer action. Through a mixed-methods ap- proach, survey participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario involving the unintended receipt of an additional lap- top from an online retailer. The study employed direct ques- tioning and the item-count technique to evaluate participants’ choices. Findings from the direct cohort revealed a significant association between geopolitical provenance and ethical deci- sions: non-Western participants were substantially more likely to return the laptop than their Western counterparts. These findings align with expectations that individuals from stricter so- cieties, often characterised by harsher regulations and greater law enforcement, may exhibit higher levels of compliance. How- ever, no such differences emerged in the indirect cohort. Re- tailer size did not significantly influence decisions in either co- hort, suggesting that perceptions of corporate influence or scale were not central to respondents’ behaviour. Crucially, the study highlights cultural norms as key drivers of moral decision-making while acknowledging the limitations of a small, student-focused sample and the challenges associated with Western versus non- Western classifications.
